			'Me and my husband have been to Amsterdam couple of times before and wanted to learn history and see something different. Anna gave us both: she told us about the foundation of the city and how it grew, some tips about architecture as well. And she showed us charming streets of Jordaan as well as some residential parts we couldn’t imagine were just around the corner. Thank you Anna for giving us a new perspective on the city we love!',
			'If you’re looking for the experience of learning about Amsterdam And its people through the lense of food or art, Marten is your guide! He has a full understanding of how different pieces of history, economy, geography etc come together to create the fabric of society you see today.',
			'We did order a Amsterdam tour with Marten - on 6 e-bikes . On arival to our meeting point Marten told us that there were no e-bikes , and all because off covid-19 , he told us. I don\'t know what covid-19 has to do with this, i think that Mr.Marten or withlocals forgot to hire the bikes in the bikestore. The tour was canceled , and I don\'t think we ever would choose mr. Marten again.',
			'It was a really lovely tour and a really nice Guide!! Thank you',
			'The bike Tour was very interesting. We saw a lot of the city with very nice places. Thanks to our friendly and well informed tour guide Aruna.',
			'Anna was open to our wishes and toured us around some hidden unexpected details of Jodaanese history and architecture. Lovely afternoon with friends walking and discovering revealing aspects of the neighborhood we live in.',
			'We did not see the museums and concert building, the swimming palace, or the Banksy street art. We received only 7 food tastings. After speaking to a WithLocals representative, we found out that Arunabha thought we were too full so he took it upon himself to skip the remaining tastings without asking us. The tour lasted only 2 hours instead of 3 like it was supposed to. Not much commentary was offered about anything. Food tours are our favorite thing to do when traveling, and this one really missed the mark. We are filled with regret over choosing this instead of Eating Europe like we usually do. Arunabha did find us an ice cream shop to satisfy our 4 year old though - thank you for that.',
			'Last week we, my daughter of 13 and me, had a great afternoon in the center of Amsterdam with Marten. We booked the tour about Anne Frank and the Jews in WW II. Marten is a very relaxed guide who knows a lot about the history of Amsterdam and he tells it all in a very enthusiastic way! My daughter also liked the tour very much, we really had a great afternoon and can only highly recommend Marten! He also does bicycle tours in Amsterdam and the surrounding areas and you can even hire him for a tour through The Netherlands!',
			'Caught up in the rush to get home before countries closed their borders and having to cut our dream holiday short, we had a one day layover in Amsterdam and were fortunate to be able to book into a With Locals tour of the city. Marten was great company and extremely passionate about the history of his city. We saw some really interesting parts of the city that we would never have found on our own, and Marten explained the historic and economic evolution of both Amsterdam and how it fit into the development of the world economic systems. We really appreciated the opportunity to both see some amazing sights, but also learn why Amsterdam is such a major part of world history. Thanks Marten!',
			'Not just a good guide, but an incredible inspirational guy! Funny too! I really recommend Marten!!',
			'Another great tour. Marten was a top host, giving us insight not only into the history of the city but also telling us more about what it\'s like to live there today. A couple of excellent restaurant recommendations too! Marten was friendly and informative. He was careful to plan the tour around our wishes, he asked whether we wanted to include the Red Light district as we had our children with us. A nice touch which was much appreciated. Thanks again Marten!',
			'Highly recommend this food tour with Marten. We tried things we never would have on our own and everything was delicious. We even went back to a few of the places days later so we could eat them again! Marten was a great conversationalist and full of fun facts. We had an awesome day! Thanks Marten!',
			'Our tour with Marten was so interesting. He was very informative and knowledgeable about Amsterdam’s history and culture and he was also very friendly. The food was very delicious at every stop. I’m so glad we booked this tour, because the food we found on our own the day before was not as good. It definitely helps to have a local’s guidance! It greatly improved the quality of our trip.',
			'For our first day in Amsterdam we booked a bike tour with Marten. It was such a great experience, Marten’s knowledge of the city and its history was truly fascinating. We would definitely recommend this tour. It enabled us to see so much more of the city with an excellent guide. Thank you Marten.',
			'Anna showed us a lot of interesting places in Amsterdam with such limited time. She is a great host, full of energy, knowledgeable, and very accommodating. I highly recommend her!',
			'It was a great tour and it was exciting to get background information about the red light district. We found it to be a great icebreaker to the red light district and felt very soon comfortable. Arun was a great guide, honest and uncomplicated. It was great that the tour was private. So he could answer customized our questions and wishes.',
			'We did a 3 hour private walking tour yesterday with Marten. He was full of information about Amsterdams history, both architecture and its people. His passion and enthusiasm made the tour both educational and enjoyable. Thanks Marten, it was a great introduction to the city.',
			'Anna was so helpful and so knowledgeable about the area. She arranged a special chocolate experience that was great she took pictures for us while we enjoyed the chocolate making process. She really customized the tour for us.',
			'Very accommodating tour guide. Learned a lot from tour because he is very informative. He even suggested local shops/resto around the the city and gave us tips on how to get around. Well done!',
			'Arun adds a ton of historical perspective, review of buildings and culture and religion here. And off course the inception and history of red light district - it all made for a great tour. Arun was subtle with his references but spared no details. We walked away pretty happy. We would recommend this tour and Arun!',
			'Rolf gave us a fantastic experience which went by too quickly. His passion for his subject really shone through. He brought the paintings to life for us in a way that enhanced our experience. Having the benefit of his amazing knowledge gave a whole new and positive dimension to our visit. He is a really superb guide.',
			'We booked a private tour at short notice. Claire was immediately in touch and set up our meeting place and time - all very easy. 2 hour tour of the Rijks was just right, too little time to do everything, but enough to get a good feel and to dig into a few artists and a few pieces of work. Claire very well informed, nice sense of humour good to chat with - we thoroughly enjoyed the tour and would recommend.',
			'Claire was fabulous. So knowledgeable about the exhibits and able to pack a lot into a short space of time. You can tell she\'s passionate about art. She speaks perfect English and is a pleasure to spend time with.',
			'We had an excellent two hours with Rolf. He guided us through the Rijksmuseum collection - his at history knowledge is brilliant and the tour took us on a fascinating journey through Dutch art! Definitely recommending him to others!!!',
			'Claire provided a perfectly edited tour of the Dutch Masters collections, highlighting the important details about selected paintings. Her presentation was delivered with in-depth knowledge, historical references and humorous stories about the artists which made the tour interesting and relevant. With a limited amount of time to spend in any one city or museum, I am not likely to walk around on my own with a guide book or headset again.',
			'Truly fantastic tour with Anna. I really like the Withlocals concept, very authentic and at home. Anna lived up to this completely. So very recommendable!! Thanks!!',
			'Rolf was a fantastic guide. He has studied history of art and it is his passion, which comes across in his informative discussions. We visited the Van Gogh Museum and Rolf\'s explanations of the history behind Van Gogh\'s art development, through his letters to his brother, made the understanding of the paintings far more enjoyable. We enjoyed the experience with Rolf so much that we booked him to guide us around the Rijksmuseum the next day. I would recommend Rolf to anyone who wants to understand their visit to the Museum\'s of Amsterdam. Thanks Rolf.',
			'Fantastic! Helena is extremely knowledgable about art and artists. Her tour made the paintings and the artists come to life!! Highly recommend!!',

We were in Amsterdam during the beginnings of the COVID-19 outbreak, and Anna was extremely attentive in helping us navigate the city with all of the closures. Anna\'s knowledge of European history is so impressive. She guided us through historical sites and was able to provide rich detail on the historical significance and added lots of color to the locations with stories and anecdotes. We felt like we were seeing the city with a walking encyclopedia! In addition, Anna has a lovely personality. She\'s fun and witty, responsible and punctual, and just a delight to spend time with. We would strongly recommend Anna to anyone interested in exploring the city in a fun and educational way. Cheers!',

It was raining and miserable weather, but he was a total sport. i was very impressed with his knowledge about the history and aftermath of WWII In regards to the city, his background with facilitation of DNA evidence in regards to identifying the victims. It was very educational. I was surprised to see the Artdeco theatre, the back story...etc.',

			'We had a very good experience with Peter in Amsterdam. He is likeable and friendly, but very serious and knowledgeable, when it comes to talking about the city and its history. Despite the continuous rain, and strong wind, we really enjoyed three hours walking along the canals. Wherever we stopped, Peter had some interesting information about the genesis of Amsterdam and it\'s history, with a special accent on the history of the city during the German occupation in WW2, and the fate of the Jewish families that lived there at that time. Whenever we had a question, he never missed a shot. Looking for a little respite from the ugly weather, we sat for half an hour in a cafe together, and chatted about our lives. Highly recommended!',
